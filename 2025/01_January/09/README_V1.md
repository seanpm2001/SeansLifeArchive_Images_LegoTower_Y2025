I had to skip my session again today due to a lack of time. I worked on other projects today, as I have struggling with the time change. I can't keep skipping these sessions, as my time with my device is limited. Recently, the back of the phone (Samsung Galaxy S20 FE) has start to come loose, and causes the screen to flicker when pulled too far. It is unacceptable for devices to be made this cheap when they cost over $1000 (within the first 2 weeks, the SIM card failed, within 6 months, the charging port, within 2 years, the speakers are severely damaged, the microphone also got severely damaged at some point, and now, less than 4 years in, the screen is falling off) I am not buying a Samsung phone again (the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge had most of the same problems within 4 years, except for the microphone, SIM card, and screen failure) and I am still working on a plan to cut Android entirely (outside of a virtual machine) - 2023, Thursday, November 9th
